* Notes: I utilized some of the previous functions I created in lab 06 and created many more functions to loop through the different cipher rotations,
calculate the frequency each letter appears in each version of the cipher, calculating the distance between each letter frequency with the english frequency vector
through the distance formula, and also looping through to find the shortest distance and outputting the string of that rotation.

My code utilized vectors, the distance formula, nested for loops, and frequency percentages from a wikipedia page. My code is commented and all of the necessary
functions are in funcs.cpp. Main.cpp does a few test cases and there are doctests which test the decoder function.
