* Fall 2021 - Lab Cipher David Abushlaih 
Notes: I utilized some of the previous functions I created along with many more functions to loop through the different cipher rotations and
calculate the frequency each letter appears in each version of the cipher. I also calculated the distance between each letter frequency with the english frequency vector through the distance formula, and looped through it to find the shortest distance and outputting the string of that rotation.

My code utilized vectors, the distance formula, nested for loops, and frequency percentages from a wikipedia page. My code is commented and all of the necessary functions are in funcs.cpp. Main.cpp does a few test cases and there are doctests which test the decoder function.
